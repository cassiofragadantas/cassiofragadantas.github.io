I'll be participating at the [ICLR 2023](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2023) conference from May 1 to May 5 2023 at Kigali, Rwanda.

With some colleagues, we'll be presenting two contributions at two different workshops:

1) [Workshop on Machine Learning for Remote Sensing](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2023/workshop/12829), in which we present a contribution titled ["Towards Explainable Land Cover Mapping: a Counterfactual-based Strategy"](https://nasaharvest.github.io/ml-for-remote-sensing/iclr2023/) in an oral presentation (the live video will be available at the workshop page).

2) [Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: Global Perspectives and Local Challenges](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2023/workshop/12828), in which we present a poster on "Disentangling observation biases to monitor spatio-temporal shifts in species distributions".

Hope to meet you there!
