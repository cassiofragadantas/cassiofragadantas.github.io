I'll be participating at [EUROPT 2021](https://europt2021.recherche.enac.fr), the 18th international workshop on continuous optimization which will take place on July 7-9 in Toulouse (virtual), France.

In my 20 minute talk, I'll be talking about my recently submitted paper ["Expanding Boundaries of Gap Safe Screening"](/publications/2021-02-01-Expanding-boundaries-of-Gap-Safe-screening).


The detailed conference program is available here: [http://europt2021.recherche.enac.fr/?page_id=909](http://europt2021.recherche.enac.fr/?page_id=909)
