I'm giving a talk titled "Explainable AI with a focus on Remote Sensing data" at [UMR MISTEA internal seminar](https://mistea.montpellier.hub.inrae.fr/rubriques-verticales2/seminaires/seminaires-internes-de-mistea) on April 22 at Montpellier, France.

The slides for this 50 minute talk are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1K57tlzFW1pNcNkoq5R22oceoQ7Qxn3ecHxxNppanphk/edit?usp=sharing). 

The abstract of the presentation is the following:

>> Enhancing the interpretability of AI techniques is paramount for increasing their acceptability, especially in highly interdisciplinary fields such as remote sensing, in which scientists and practitioners with diverse backgrounds work together to monitor the Earthâ€™s surface. In this talk, I will provide a brief introduction to the emerging field of Explainable AI (XAI), hovering over some of the main existing approaches to enhance interpretability in modern machine/deep learning models. In a second part of the presentation, I will present our recent contribution on counterfactual explanations for satellite image time series data.
