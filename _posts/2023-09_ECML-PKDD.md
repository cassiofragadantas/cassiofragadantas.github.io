I'll be participating at the [ECML-PKDD 2023](https://2023.ecmlpkdd.org/) conference from the 18th to the 22th of September 2023 at Torino, Italy.

I'll be giving an oral presentation of our [paper](https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-04189631) on "Counterfactual Explanations for Remote Sensing Time Series Data: an Application to Land Cover Classification".

Hope to meet you there!
