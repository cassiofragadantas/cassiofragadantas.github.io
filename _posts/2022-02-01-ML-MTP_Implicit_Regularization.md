I'm leading a reading group session on Implicit Regularizatoin / Optimization bias at [ML-MTP](https://groupes.renater.fr/wiki/ml-mtp/) seminar on February 3rd, 2PM, at IMAG (room 109), University of Montpellier.

My slides summarizing results from several papers on this topic are available [here](https://groupes.renater.fr/wiki/ml-mtp/_media/wiki/2022_02_implicit_regularization.pdf).
