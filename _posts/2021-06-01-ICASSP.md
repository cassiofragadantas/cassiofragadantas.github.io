I'll be participating at [ICASSP](https://2021.ieeeicassp.org), IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing which will take place on July 6-11 in Toronto (virtual), Canada.

I'll be presenting (slides + poster) a paper entitled ["Safe screening for sparse regression with the Kullback-Leibler divergence"](/publications/2021-06-01-Safe-screening-for-sparse-regression-with-the-Kullback-Leibler-divergence).
