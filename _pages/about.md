I am a CNRS postdoctoral researcher at [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/) in Toulouse, France,
in the context of the ERC project [FACTORY](http://projectfactory.irit.fr/).

I obtained my PhD in November 2019 from University of Rennes 1, supervised by [RÃ©mi Gribonval](https://people.irisa.fr/Remi.Gribonval/) at [Inria Rennes](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-rennes-bretagne-atlantique). 

Previously, I obtained a double degree in Electrical Engineering at [University of Campinas](https://www.fee.unicamp.br/?language=en) (Bachelor) and [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) (Dipl. Ing.) in 2014 followed by a Master's degree from University of Campinas in 2016, supervised by [Renato R. Lopes](https://www.decom.fee.unicamp.br/~rlopes/). I also have three years of R&D experience at Idea! Electronic Systems, UPMC and Schneider Electric. 

My recent research activities lie on the frontier between signal processing, machine learning and convex optimization.


Main research topics:
- Matrix/tensor factorization
- Non-smooth optimization
- Sparse signal/image processing
- Multi-dimensional data modeling
