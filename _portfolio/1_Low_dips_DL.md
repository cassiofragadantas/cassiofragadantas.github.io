Displacement structure[^1] is a generic procedure to quantify the level structure in a matrix.
It defines a certain operation (displacement operator) that transform structured matrices into low-rank matrices.
The displacement structure framework also provides **fast computational algorithms** for operations involving these structured matrices.

Besides coping with explicit families of structured matrices like Toeplitz, Hankel, Vandermonde and Cauchy, 
it also manages to identify **implicit structure** like the inverse or products of structured matrices.


This work was developed during my Master's degree:

It includes a black-and-white image denoising demo.
